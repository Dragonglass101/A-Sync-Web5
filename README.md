## About The Project

### Motivation 

Our motivation to embark on the Web5 project is rooted in a profound commitment to redefine the landscape of the internet, ushering in an era where users wield genuine authority over their online identities and data. At the heart of our initiative lies a dedication to the core principles of Web5, envisioning a digital realm that places a premium on user-centricity, privacy, seamless data flow, and empowerment.

Crucially, within the Web5 framework, the security and ownership of user data is priortized. With a focus on privacy, all user-generated data is now securely stored in the user's Digital Web Node (DWN). This ensures that users have complete control and ownership over their data, granting them the authority to decide which applications can access and utilize their information. This empowerment represents a fundamental shift in how data is handled, placing the user at the center of their digital experience.

In pursuit of this vision, we have meticulously crafted two interlinked applications â€“ a Workout Assistance and a Diet Assistance tool â€“ leveraging the transformative potential of Web5 to offer a glimpse into the dynamic future of the web. These applications, thoughtfully curated to showcase the inherent capabilities of Web5, are designed to significantly contribute to the well-being of users, acting as a testament to the positive impact that technology can have on people's lives.



### Introduction

The Workout Assistance application facilitates the tracking and planning of workouts, while the Diet Assistance application enables users to monitor and plan their dietary choices. What sets our approach apart is the seamless integration of these two applications. We recognize the intrinsic connection between exercise and nutrition and have bridged the gap by leveraging the power of Web5.

Consider this scenario: a typical workout application may recommend high-intensity cardio exercises without any insight into the user's dietary habits. This lack of context can have critical implications for an individual's health. However, through the implementation of Web5, our applications transcend these limitations. User data generated across both applications is securely stored in the user's Digital Web Node (DWN). Now, with explicit user permission, the Workout Assistance application gains access to the user's diet data.

This strategic collaboration between the Workout and Diet Assistance applications, made possible by Web5, ensures that the workout recommendations for the next day are tailored with precision. No longer confined by siloed data and isolated insights, our users benefit from a holistic approach that considers their exercise routines in tandem with their dietary patterns.

In essence, our Web5 project empowers users to selectively share and leverage their data across applications, offering a level of customization and personalization that was previously unimaginable. Through this interconnected ecosystem, we aim to set a new standard for user-centric technologies, where privacy, data ownership, and informed decision-making are paramount.

By building these applications on the foundation of Web5, we aspire to contribute to a paradigm shift in the digital landscape, championing a future where technology is not just powerful but, more importantly, beneficial and empowering for every user.

### Features

#### Grant Access Permissions 

One of the groundbreaking features we've implemented in our Web5 project is the user-configurable data access protocol, a testament to the core strength of Web5 and its transformative potential. This feature empowers users with unprecedented control over their data, allowing them to grant explicit permissions to other applications for accessing information generated across different platforms. The ability to seamlessly share specific data points between applications is a game-changer, marking a paradigm shift in how users interact with their digital environment.

At the heart of this innovation is a user-friendly interface that facilitates the effortless configuration of access permissions. With just a few clicks, users can specify which applications are granted access to particular datasets, ensuring a tailored and personalized digital experience. The real-time nature of our user-configurable protocol means that access permissions are updated instantly as users make changes, creating a dynamic and responsive ecosystem.

#### Share Workouts and Meals with Friends.

The ability to share our workout routines and meals seamlessly with friends through their Decentralized Identifiers (DID) is an extraordinary feature embedded in both our applications. This functionality not only enhances the social aspect of our health and wellness journey but also fosters a supportive and collaborative environment. By leveraging DIDs, users can effortlessly connect with friends, allowing them to share fitness achievements, meal plans, and progress in a secure and privacy-focused manner. This feature opens up avenues for mutual encouragement, goal-sharing, and even friendly competitions, creating a community-driven approach to health and well-being.

#### Recommended Workouts and Meals.

In essence, our "Recommended Workouts or Meals" feature represents a pivotal aspect of our applications, prioritizing a personalized and comprehensive approach to health and wellness. Beyond mere convenience, this feature becomes a necessity, guiding users towards their fitness objectives and fostering a balanced lifestyle. Leveraging the power of Web5, our implementation of Grant Permission and data-sharing capabilities enables a revolutionary synergy between workout and diet applications. By analyzing user data from both realms, we provide tailored recommendations that consider individual exercise history and nutritional habits. This interconnected approach breaks free from isolated data silos, offering a holistic understanding of the user's health profile and, consequently, generating more effective and sustainable fitness plans.

## Challenges Faced
We are new to the Tezos Block chain are so we ran into soem issues while the duration of this project,
1. It took major time to resolve erros in smartpy due to lack of proper error messages and documentation regarding the errors.
2. The Becon Wallet was not compatible with the latest React JS version (18) due to which we had to use version 16.
3. The resources for the working of Angellist were scarce.

### Major issues
2 days prior to the deadline, the infura ipfs service stopped working due to which we had to switch to a different service
(nft.storage). This caused a major backlash due to which we had to restructure the project accordingly. If not for this
inconvenience we would have implemented more features we had initially decided.

## Future Aspects and Scope
Royalty On FA2 Company Tokens: 
Unlike traditional stock-trading using FA2 token the seller of token will get Royalty of 5% on the trade profit done buy the successive buyers of this tokens.
By this we will encourage people to built great companies on blockchain as the early you become owner of the tokens longer you get the profit (each owner will keep getting royalty until the those tokens are in the market). The above feature is already half implemented.

CRON jobs : Introducing CRON jobs to automate the buying and selling FA2 company tokens (which are currently being triggered by confirmations) instead directly initiate tokens transfer whenever avaliable at the buyer's price.

Coinbase: If any user on the platform is deficiet of Tez instead of going to other platforms for buying tez he can buy tez directly from our platform. By making this buying process easy we will encourage the users to keep trading in Tez which will help in growth of Tezos Ecosystem. The above feature is almost close to completition.

USDT/USDC: According to the research USDT stable coin has came on the Tezos blockchain recently in June 2022. USDC.e is coin on ethereum blockchain. For allowing the transactions in USDC.e there need to build an bridge between the two blockchain. We hope to enable transactions in this two coins in the near future.

## Guide to setup the project locally
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x +
- Node v12.x +

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">Top</a></p>

### Setup, Run, Compile & Deploy Steps :


1.  `npm install` it will install all your dependencies

2.  `npm run client-install` it will install all the client dependencies i.e in React

> If step 2 does not work then go to the 'client' directory and run 'npm install'

3.  `npm run sync` this is a syncing command. Whenever the compile_config is changed in config.json this command must be executed from the terminal. This command helps the bundle to reconfigure the compilation parameters according to the changes you have made.

4.  `npm run compile` will build the contracts locally inside the folder ./contract_build. This command compiles the python file to a Michelson file and stores it in the ./contract_build folder.

5.  `npm run deploy` will deploy your contract with the params respect to your config.json

6.  `npm run dapp` It will spin-up the Dapp front-end and you are ready to use it. This Bundle is packed up with simple create-react-app. Once you run the command the front-end dev server will start up and you will be redirected to your home page in your default browser.

7.  `npm run test` It will run the whole template of SmartPy code with their scenario based testing. And the test results will be visualised in the teminal.
>Step 7 will also generate a test_build where your test results will be stored.

8.  `npm run get-entry-points` It will extract the entry-points from you recently compiled code and display in the terminal with a sample invocation which you can reference while invoking an entry-point from your dapp.
9.  *`npm run sync` is mandatory whenever your config.json file is changed !*
